# Detecting Human Settlements from Sentinel-2 Imagery
Developing an effective machine learning model for detecting human settlements in satellite imagery is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it supports Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. By accurately monitoring population growth and urban expansion, this technology can aid in urban planning, resource allocation, and disaster management.

# Summary of Approach
Stratified Group K-Fold Cross validation, stastical feature engineering (Implementation of vegetation indices should improve the prediction capability of the model). 


# Model Architecture
Light Gradient Boosting Algorithm (LGBM)
